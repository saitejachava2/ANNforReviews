# Artifical Neural Networks for predicting user reviews
The dataset is about online product reviews which is 
taken from Datafiniti's Product Repository has 
compiled a list of more than 71,045 reviews from 
1,000 various brands. The review's text including 
title, as well as the item's name including provider, 
user information, and much more, are all included in 
the dataset. I have used best 
neural network techniques which is CBOW, LSTM 
and CNN to get the best accuracies and results for 
Text Classification process. I have achieved 
the best results, where the accuracy for CBOW 
technique is 88% while the accuracy for LSTM is 
83%.
